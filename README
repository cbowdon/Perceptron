; The training data is a bunch of 25x25 black/white images.  The perceptron is to
; identify which images are of a letter A and which ones are not.  I created the 
; data in GIMP, saved as an HTML table, and used sed to convert it into a list of
; pixel colors.  I would right a blog about it, but its now nearly 3am.  It's snowing
; outside and I'd like to go play in the snow, but I think sleep is more important 
; right now.
