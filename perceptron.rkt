; The training data is a bunch of 25x25 black/white images.  The perceptron is to
; identify which images are of a letter A and which ones are not.  I created the 
; data in GIMP, saved as an HTML table, and used sed to convert it into a list of
; pixel colors.  I would right a blog about it, but its now nearly 3am.  It's snowing
; outside and I'd like to go play in the snow, but I think sleep is more important 
; right now.

;initialize our perceptron.

;how to train your perceptron...

(define (train)
  (for ([path (in-directory "images/training")])
    (when (and (regexp-match? #rx"[.]img$" path) 
               (not (regexp-match? #rx"25.0.img$" path))) ; removing img 25 because it constantly fails
      (train-perceptron (path->string path)))))

; how to test your perceptron...

(define (test)
  (printf "~a\t~a\t~a\n"
          (linear-classifier (img->vector "images/sample/test1.img"))
          (linear-classifier (img->vector "images/sample/test2.img"))
          (linear-classifier (img->vector "images/sample/test3.img"))))

;let's see what it thinks before training
(test)

;I ran some tests and realized it gets a tad bit better if you train it on
;the same data several times.  There's one image it just can't get right.
;Maybe it needs more training data? or maybe this is just a silly way to do
;this

; NB. Training to 100 doesn't help. Converges around 10, except for img 25
(for-each (位 (x) (train) (test)) (build-list 10 values))

;that really wasn't great.  it has a false postive.  oh well!
